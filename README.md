As a personal trainer and self-taught web developer, my journey has been filled with learning and growth. Initially drawn to the technology and design behind online fitness resources, I decided to teach myself the skills and tools needed to build my own websites and applications.
While it has been a challenging journey at times, the process of learning and applying my initial training in exercise science to the world of web development has been incredibly rewarding. I have been able to create user-centered fitness applications and resources that help people lead healthier, more active lives.
Even though I am yet to fully have a foothold in web development, I am still on the learning path and constantly growing in my skills. I am grateful to have the opportunity to pursue both of my passions and am excited to see where my journey takes me next.
If you are also interested in self-taught web development and are passionate about both careers, I hope my story will inspire you to pursue your own path. With hard work and dedication, you too can achieve your goals and build a rewarding career in the tech industry.
